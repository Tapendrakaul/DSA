# DSA Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! This repository documents my journey to mastering DSA concepts and coding patterns, which are essential for efficient problem-solving in competitive programming and technical interviews.

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of problems, implementations, and explanations of data structures and algorithms as I work through various resources, courses, and problem sets. The aim is to document my learning process and create a reference for future projects and interviews.

## Goals

- **Understand and implement core data structures and algorithms.**
- **Practice DSA problems on platforms like LeetCode, CodeChef, and HackerRank.**
- **Write clean, optimized code with explanations for each solution.**
- **Track progress and improvements over time.**

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on data structures, algorithms, and problem sets:

## Topics Covered

This list will be updated as I progress. Topics include:

- **Data Structures:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Hash Tables, etc.
- **Algorithms:** Sorting (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort), Searching (e.g., Binary Search), Graph Traversal (DFS, BFS), Greedy Algorithms, Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming, etc.
- **Problem-Solving Patterns:** Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Recursion, Backtracking, etc.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.10**
- Any necessary dependencies, which can be installed using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each folder contains self-contained code examples with explanations. To run specific scripts, navigate to the directory and execute them as follows:

```bash
python path/to/your_script.py
```

Examples and explanations are included in each file to enhance learning and readability.
